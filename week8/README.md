- [p5 review: nested for loops, random, logic](https://owenroberts.github.io/mmp210/week8/index.html)

**Midterm**
- Create a sketch that generates new patterns
- Each time the sketch is loaded a variation of your basic pattern should appear
- The sketch must use variables, a for loop, colors, and shapes
- Use a series of decisions (if, else) or randomly generated values to change the pattern
