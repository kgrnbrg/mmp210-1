			<h2>setup() and draw()</h2>
			<p>Before we look at system variables, let's review <code>setup()</code> and <code>draw()</code>, because we'll need them in our lesson.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/setup" target="blank">setup()</a> is called <strong>once</strong> when the page loads, and defines some initial variables and does other things we only want to do once, like loading image data, or perhaps setting the background color.</li>
				<li><a href="http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/draw" target="blank">draw()</a> after setup() is done, draw() will loop continuously (unless <code>noLoop()</code> is called) until the browser window is closed.  Every line inside of the draw() function will be called in order everytime it runs, often as fast as 60 frames per second.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>This simple program will demonstrate setup() and draw():</p>
			<pre><code>var x;

function setup() {
    x = 100;
}

function draw() {
    background(255);
    
    x++;

    text(x, 20, 20);
}</code></pre>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p><span class="note">A quick note on scope:</span> We'll talk about scope in more detail later in the semester, but at this point it's important to understand that in order for a variable to be used by both setup() and draw(), it must be declared outside of both functions, usually at the beginning of our program.</p>
